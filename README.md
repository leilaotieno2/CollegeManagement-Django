The College Management System is a web application that is developed using Python and the Django web framework. This project is meant to aid in managing student, staff, and course records of an educational institution.
It provides a way for users whereby administrators, teachers, and students may access and manipulate important data regarding college activities, such as student registration, student attendance tracking, leave management, and notification sending.
